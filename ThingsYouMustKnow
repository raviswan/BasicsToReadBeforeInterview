Big 0:
=====
 - worse case asymptotic analysis. It means we want to find the worst-case  time or space compelxity when the input grows very large.
 - Polynomial  where n is the base: n^2 or n or logn. i.e. O(n^k) where k=0,1,2 etc.
 - Exponential is when n is in the exponent. Eg. 2^n, 3^n, n^n
 - For recursion when you do bigO, look for the longest path as that;s the worst case. When there are no optimizations, you also have to take the repetitions at each recursive level. Draw the recursive tree in that case.
 - For DP: it's similar to recursion. But only the longest path will be important, because at each level, you are gonna use
   some O(1) operation. 
   
 
 P vs NP:
 =======
 P here is polynomial time. NP means Non-Deterministic polynomial. This means the for NP, the problems are verifiable in polynomial time, but they may or may not be solvable in polynomial time. 
    - This means P belongs to NP space. If P=NP, then P and NP become the same space. Else, P is a subset of NP space.
    - NP-complete: These are the toughest problems in NP space. They are verifiable in polynomial time. If we find polynomial solution to one NP-complete problem, it implies all other NP-complete problems can be solved in polynomial time by either reduction or transformaiton.
    - NP-hard problem: Encompasses NP-complete problem. However, they dont fully belong in the NP space because not all NP-hard problems verifiable in polynomial time, let alone solvable in P time.
    
 

C++

Constructors of any kind : no return value
--------------------------------------------
COPY CONSTRUCTOR -(important to have const)

MyClass(const MyClass& other){
	deepCopy()
}

--------------------------------------------
ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR - (note: where const is, why return has no const and returning *this)

MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other){
	if(this == &other)
		return *this;
	else{
		processing;
		return *this;
	}
}

--------------------------------------------
INHERITANCE -Remember protected is to help derived classes access base member variables.
class Vehicle{
	public:
		virtual bool drive();
		virtual ~Vehicle();
	protected:
		int der;
	private:
		int priv;

	
}
class Car:public Vehicle{
	virtual bool drive(){
		der = val;
	}
	virtual ~Car();	
}

--------------------------------------------
DIAMOND PROBLEM with multiple inheritance. Solve with virtual base class while inheriting classes 
with common parent.

--------------------------------------------
EXCEPTION: remember stack unwinds until you find matching catch. If not, program aborts
try{
	throw something;
}
/*catch all*/
catch(...){
	
}
--------------------------------------------
SHARED,WEAK AND UNIQUE_PTR
--------------------------------------------
Shared_ptr and weak_ptr: creates managed object and manager object. The latter keeps track of
the shared_ptr count and weak_ptr count. When shared_ptr count goes to zero,
the actual object (ie.managed object is deleted), but manager object sticks around.
That is only deleted when weak pointer goes to zero.

Unique_ptr: Only one can own the object at any given time. No copy constructors and 
copy assignment allowed.For passing as function argument, use pass by reference.
Transferring ownership of unique pointer is done by std::move 
Move constructor and move assignment operator are defined for uniqe pointer

unique_ptr<Thing> p1(new Thing); // p1 owns the Thing
unique_ptr<Thing> p2; // p2 owns nothing
// invoke move assignment explicitly
p2 = std::move(p1); // now p2 owns it, p1 owns nothing
// invoke move construction explicitly
unique_ptr<Thing> p3(std::move(p2)); // now p3 owns it, p2 and p1 own nothing


--------------------------------------------
	Virtual Function Table (VFT)
--------------------------------------------
	-  IMPORTANT: 1 VFT per class. But every object will have a "vptr" pointing to its class' VFT entry 
	-  VFT is stored in static area of a program.
	- Anytime you create object in heap, there will be vptr prefixed to the object that points to VFT entry for that 
		class.
	- So invoking right function  with base pointer is matter of using vptr and right offset into the VFT table entry
	- the functions are arranged in such a way there is functions with same name are at same offsets in VFT
	-Refer to Favorited StackOverflow page for multiple inheritance


-----------------------------------------------------
				MULTITHREADING 
-----------------------------------------------------
REMEMBER: mutex, thread, future, lock are all only movable, not copyable
1) Thread object
	std::thread t1(func, arg1, ref(arg2))
This will run func(int arg1, string & arg2) in a separate thread.
2) To lock the resource use,
	std::mutex m; 
	Mutex m has its own lock and unlock(), But don't use it. Instead go below

But this maybe used as lock_guard or unique_lock()

3)This is exception safe . Prefer lockguard when needed
lock_guard<mutex> locker(m){
	do thread safe operation
}
4) unique_lock<mutex> ulocker(m);  ====>  ulocker.unlock(); 
unique_lock can lock  and unlock the mutex  any number of times.

5) std::condition_variable cond;  Used to signal and wait for condition to be met.
	cond.notify_one(); //notify one thead
	cond.notify_all(); /notify all threadds
	cond.wait(ulocker); //you need locker because when the signal is received, the resource is 		
	 					//locked. WHich then needs to be unlocked
	//Do some processing
	....

	ulocker.unlock();

5) If you wanns run a resource just once in a thread safe way, do:
	std::once_flag flag;
	std::call_once(flag, [&](){ one time operation});

6) Async is used to run a new thread and return value. 
 Async may or may not spawn a new thread, Specify parameters for that in the async call
 to force it to create a new thread.
 std::future<int> f = std::async(func, a);
//  To get the value returned by async, make a call to get().
//Remembercan be called ONLY ONCE. After that it returns error,
	int x = f.get();

7)If you wanna a pass a value from parent to child thread, you can use promise:
	std::promise<int> p;
	std::future<int> f1 = p.get_future();

	Now inside the child thread, you will get the future like:
	func(std::future<int>& f){
		int n = f.get();
	}
 	//do other things.
 	//Now pass value to child thread
 	p.set_value(44);
 	After this call, n inside the child thread will get the value 44.

8) If you wanna send the same future to multiple child threads, you can't use above
future as is, because f.get() can be called only once.
Solution:
	shared_future<int> sf = f.share();
	This can be copied, unlike future, which is only movable.

9) Remember: The argument passed to thread can not only be a func, but any
CALLABLE object. eg.

Class A{
	int f(string a, int b);
	int g(int c);
	int operator()(int v){};
}

int main(){
	A a;
	thread t1(a, 6); //makes a copy of a, and calls functor on that in new thread
	thread t1(ref(a), 6); // uses a by calling its functor
	thread t1(move(a), 6); //moves a to new thread
	thread t1([](int val){ return val+1;}, 6); // lambda call executed in a new thread
	thread t1(&A::g, a, 6); // calls copy of a.g(6) in a new thread
	thread t1(&A::g, &a, 6); //calls a.g(6) in a new thread
}

These are equally applicable for std::bind(), std::async()
